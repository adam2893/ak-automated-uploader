# ak-automated-uploader

AK Automated Uploader is a web-based torrent uploader tool for private trackers.

Well, a few private trackers. More coming. Probably.

Upload files by picking them via the web UI, or go fully automated with the API.

## Prerequisites

Any new-ish version of the following should do. Put them in your PATH.

- [Bun](https://bun.com/)
- [ffmpeg/ffprobe](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
- [mkbrr](https://mkbrr.com/)

You'll also need a TMDB API key.

## Getting started

Download the latest release and run the following:

```
bun install
ORIGIN=http://localhost:51901 PORT=51901 bun build/index.js
```

Or on PowerShell:

```
$env:ORIGIN = "http://localhost:51901"
$env:PORT = "51901"
bun install
bun build/index.js
```

Configure your image hosts, torrent client, and trackers on the settings page.

## Docker image

Or use the Docker image at `ghcr.io/aqtku/ak-automated-uploader:latest`.

Here's a docker-compose:

```
services:
  uploader:
    image: ghcr.io/aqtku/ak-automated-uploader:latest
    container_name: ak-automated-uploader
    ports:
      - "51901:51901"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - /path/to/your/media:/mnt:ro
    environment:
      - PORT=51901
      - ORIGIN=http://localhost:51901
      - APPDATA=/config
      - HOME=/mnt
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Known issues

- Needs a pretty clean scene or P2P filename to work because the checker for
  data in the filename is a whitelist.
- No support for full discs yet.
## Single-file executable (macOS)

A single-file macOS executable is available in the `packaging/` directory. It
embeds the Bun runtime, the app, all client assets, and the native tools the
app shells out to (ffmpeg, ffprobe, mkbrr) plus the native libraries sharp and
mediainfo.js need. Run it directly — no Bun, Node, or npm install required:

```
./ak-automated-uploader
```

It listens on http://127.0.0.1:51901 by default (override with `PORT`/`HOST`/
`ORIGIN` env vars). Settings are stored in
`~/Library/Preferences/ak-automated-uploader/`. The first time it runs it
extracts the embedded native tools to a temp directory.

To build it yourself:

```bash
./packaging/fetch-third-party.sh   # downloads ffmpeg/ffprobe/mkbrr binaries
bun run packaging/build-executable.ts
```

The executable is written to `dist/ak-automated-uploader` and ad-hoc
codesigned for macOS arm64.
